# Flavoursome-Nibbles
Hi there. This is Flavoursome Nibbles a site I created as part of coursework of a web devlopment class, Second Year, Semester 1. 

# About
Flavoursome Nibbles has grown from my passion for flavourful foods. Experiencing diverse cultures is something I strive to do. What better way to do that than through food? Much cheaper than catching a flight but still experiencing the traditions that different cultures have. Food tells a story and holds history. Some meals bring comforts and are past through generations. Others use the influence from different vistors to evolve the way they're prepared, presented and enjoyed. Either way food holds culture.

Admist the all to familar steakhouse and Italian spots. There are hidden gems waiting to be discoverd. Why not shine some light on them?

Through different cultures hear the stories that are shared while bonding over the meals. After all that is what food is all about.
Travel and experience stories worthy of being told one forkful at a time.
Don't forget to navigate out main pages through the slideshow!
